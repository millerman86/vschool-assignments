The year is 1985. Your job is to build a text-based (console) RPG game.

The point of this exercise is to better master Javascript functions, loops, conditionals, and some data types.

Project Requirements:
1. Console must greet player with a fun message
2. Console must ask for the player's name and store it


3. Walking:
* The console will ask the user to enter a "w" to walk
* Every time the player walks, a random algorithm will be run that determines if a wild enemy has appeared (A 1/3 or 1/4 chance of being attacked)


4. If a wild enemy appears:
* The enemy is random (can be chosen out of a minimum of 3 different enemy names)
* The user can decide to attack or run
* If attacking, a random amount of damage will be delt between a min and max
* If running, there will be a 50% chance of escaping
* After the player attacks or runs the enemy attacks back for a random damage amount
* If the player kills the enemy you can give the Player some HP and a special item that is stored in the inventory
* If the enemy kills the player the console prints an cool death message and the game ends


1. Inventory
* When the player kills enemies, they are awarded with items
* If the user enters 'Print' in the console, the console will print the players name,*  HP, and each item in their inventory
* Passing Criteria: Demo to the Instructor/TA & Code Review
* An instructor or TA will look through your code with you and make sure you have a solid grasp on using functions, loops, and conditionals in JavaScript, as well as to verify that you're following JavaScript code standards and good general programming practices.
