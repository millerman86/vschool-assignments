Welcome to my code sampler!
===========================


My name is Amren Miller and this is my Github repository for all the various things I know about 
about web development. Just like you would go to a buffet at a Chinese restaurant and sample all 
the various foods, this repository contains code that shows a little bit of all the various skills 
I have, and it's all demonstrated using the React framework. 

I will be using different back-ends with this particular project, but for now, I will be focusing 
on just React for the front. I will be starting off by coding everything statically first and then 
adding dynamic interactivity later. 

In addition to this, I will also be creating README's in every folder explaining in detail what everything 
does. 

I hope you enjoy looking through some of my work!
