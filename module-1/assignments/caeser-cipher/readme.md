For this exercise, you will be implementing a Caeser cipher using Javascript. Your program will receive two inputs:

1. The text to be encoded
2. The number positions to shift each letter (to the right)


You only have to shift letters that are part of the 26-letter alphabet. Any other characters (such as spaces) should be printed as they were received. The shift value will always be on the interval [0, 26].
