# Travel form
You just started your own airline, and you need to create a form to collect data about your passengers' upcoming travel plans so they can book their flight.

You should collect the following information from the user:

* First name (text input)
* Last name (text input)
* Age (number input)
* Gender (radio buttons with 2 or more options)
* Location they're traveling to (select box with at least 3 options. You're an airline that doesn't * fly to many places...)
* Whether they have any dietary restrictions (check boxes for vegetarian, kosher, lactose free, etc. * Include at least 3 options)
* Each element of the form should be given a name attribute so you can access the data in JavaScript and do stuff with it.

There should also be a button at the end of the form to submit it. Upon pressing the button, an alert should pop up that looks like this:**
