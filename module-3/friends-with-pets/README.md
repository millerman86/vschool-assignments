Build a simple React app that has a <FriendList /> component, a <Friend /> component and a <Pet /> component.

In <FriendList />, .map() through an array of friends. Each friend will have an array of pets. Feel free to use array at the bottom of this write up. In your .map(), render a <Friend /> component, passing through the name, age, and pets of each friend as props.

<Friend /> Should display the info nicely. Use some styles and appropriate HTML(JSX) tags. <Friend /> Should also .map() through the pets array and render <Pet />. Pets should also be displayed nicely.

Think about how you display strings, numbers, and arrays while building this app.

const friends = [
  {
    name: "Ben",
    age: 29,
    pets: [
      {
        name: "spot",
        breed: "tabby"
      },{
        name: "John Johnson",
        breed: "husky"
      },{
        name: "Bear the bear",
        breed: "Grizzly"
      }
    ]
  },{
    name: "Bob",
    age: 31,
    pets: [
      {
        name: "Sally",
        breed: "Australian Shepard"
      }
    ]
  },{
    name: "Marcus",
    age: 25,
    pets: [
      {
        name: "Indy",
        breed: "Akita"
      },{
        name: "Anna",
        breed: "persian cat"
      }
    ]
  },{
    name: "Jacob",
    age: 20,
    pets: [
      {
        name: "fluffy",
        breed: "sphynx cat"
      },{
        name: "patches",
        breed: "sphynx cat"
      },{
        name: "tiger",
        breed: "sphynx cat"
      },{
        name: "oscar",
        breed: "sphynx cat"
      }
    ]
  }
