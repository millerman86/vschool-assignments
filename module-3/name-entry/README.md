Build a simple react app with an input box, an <h1>, a button, and an ordered list. The user will type names into the input box.

When the user types in the input box, the <h1> should update to show the same text as the input box.

When the user clicks the button, the value of the input box should be added to a running list of names that have been previous entered. (Hint: you'll need to set state and map over an array to do this).
