Write an Express server to handle a GET request that returns an object (of any kind) as a response.

Write a middleware function in a separate JavaScript file that accepts the req, res, and next parameters, adds a property to the req, and allows the server to continue on with it's normal operation.

Pull that module into your main server code and set it up as middleware.

Use Postman to make the GET request and test whether your middleware did its job.
